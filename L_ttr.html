							<h2>Because all my board games have house rules. <br> And are better for it.</h2>

							<p>My family had a problem. There weren't many board games we could play together -- let alone finish -- before bickering beat us all. Ticket To Ride by Days of Wonder, however, was an exception, but even we we were starting to feel the wear and tear of playing our go-to game as much as we were seeing it, frayed edges on the board, substitute pieces, beer-stained playing cards. The inevitable victory by yours trutly. My solution? Create a new board for my family inspired by vacations and memories.</p>
							<p>This train trip down memory lane, however, mixes nostalgic memories with the reality of family life: competition and ruthless gameplay. I added custom bonus cards, some of which can be seen below, to keep the chaos going until the last dice roll. I spent more time in Excel seeking mathematically balanced gameplay than I did creating, placing, and perfecting countless layers in Photoshop and InDesign. My version had to not just be playable, but replayable. And it was. I was able to extend my family's boardgame huddles by a few more years.</p>
